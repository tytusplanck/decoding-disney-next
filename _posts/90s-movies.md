One of the biggest surprises about raising my son has been how much we've gravitated toward old-school Disney movies. In prepping for our Disney World trips, we focused on movies that tied into the parks—and what we quickly realized? The little dude LOVES the classics. Now, don't get me wrong. _Bluey_ is great. But when it comes to family movie nights, we keep finding ourselves hitting play on Disney's 90s golden era. So, if you're looking to introduce your kid to some animated greatness (and sneak in some nostalgia for yourself), here’s the must-watch list:

---

## 1. _The Lion King_

The first movie my son completely fell in love with. The music? Iconic. The animation? Timeless. The story? A perfect mix of adventure, humor, and emotional highs. And let's talk about _I Just Can’t Wait to Be King_—the colors, the energy, the absolute banger of a song. It’s easily one of my favorites, and now my kid’s too.

## 2. _Mulan_

This one's got it all—action, humor, and one of Disney’s best soundtracks (_I’ll Make a Man Out of You_ is a family anthem at this point). Plus, Mushu? Peak comedy. I cackled just as hard as my kid.

## 3. _Toy Story_

It’s wild how well this movie holds up. The animation may have been groundbreaking in '95, but the real magic is in the story. Friendship, imagination, and just the right amount of chaos make this one an instant hit with kids.

## 4. _Aladdin_

Robin Williams as the Genie is the reason this movie is legendary. Add in a charming street rat, a rebellious princess, and some of Disney’s best songs, and you've got a certified classic.

## 5. _The Little Mermaid_

Under the sea, underappreciated by kids today! My son was obsessed with all the sea creatures, pointing out every fish, crab, and eel like he was narrating a Nat Geo documentary. Add in Sebastian’s _Under the Sea_ and you’ve got a movie that’s just pure fun.

## 6. _Beauty and the Beast_

This movie is basically a Broadway show in animated form—big, sweeping musical numbers, rich storytelling, and layered characters that make it just as compelling for adults as it is for kids. My son loved the enchanted castle crew, and honestly, _Be Our Guest_ still goes hard.
